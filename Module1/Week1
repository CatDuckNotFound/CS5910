Here in Week1 Of Coursera Specialization Moduele1. 
I've learnt about multiple concepts Such as -:
- CIA triad InDepth
- Defense in Depth
- Risk and Risk Assetment
- Risk management Framework [http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma/framework.html]
- Aws
In this Project during Week1. Our primary objective was to Ceate a aws-Ec2 instance by copying from coursera_cs5910_im2 AMI image in North Virginia AWS region with LAMP package. 
We were supposed to set-up web page on Server instance.
With limited AWS budget. We were supposed to choose min instance. While making proper use of our budget. We created Key-pair login.
We made our security configuration so that only we can only authorize access/indbound request.  While restricting access from external ip address.

i accessed my aws-linux from my pc using 
[ ssh -i [login.pem] ec2-user@ip_addr ];

After accesing my instance. I developed my another instance on my own. For setting up my webserver I used up this following refrences:
 --- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/linux/al2/ug/ec2-lamp-amazon-linux-2.html
 --- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/SSL-on-amazon-linux-2.html

After following and completing my configuration. I created my html page on /var/www/html/index.html. 

The result is: https://github.com/CatDuckNotFound/CS5910/edit/main/Module1/Screenshot at 2024-05-03 12-30-14.png
